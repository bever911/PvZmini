## 🎯 Recommended Deployment Path

**For your 10-year-old to share with friends:**

1. Start with **GitHub Pages** (free, simple)
2. If you want easier updates, try **Netlify**
3. If you want a game community, use **itch.io**

**My recommendation: GitHub Pages** because:
- Free forever
- Easy to learn
- Great for your portfolio
- Your son can learn Git/GitHub (valuable skill!)

## 🔒 Privacy & Safety Notes

- GitHub Pages: Repository must be public (code is visible)
- Netlify/Vercel: Can be private
- itch.io: Game is public, but source code isn't visible

**For a family project:** Any of these are safe and appropriate!
